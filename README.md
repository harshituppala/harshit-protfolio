# Personal Portfolio – Harshit Uppala

The code of my personal portfolio website.

This website includes my experience, technical skills, projects of interest and certifications during my quest to become a software developer, DevOps and IT professional.

It was built with:

- HTML5
- CSS3 (responsive, no frameworks used)
- Javascript (for routing between sections on the same page via navigation)

Deployment

To deploy this site using GitHub Pages:

1. Go to **Settings → Pages**
2. Under “Branch,” select:
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Folder:** `/ (root)`
3. Save the changes

GitHub Pages will generate a public link to your portfolio.
